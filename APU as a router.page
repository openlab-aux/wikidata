# APU as router HowTo
## Installation

### Debian

Install a regular Debian amd64.

Edit `/etc/default/grub` and add/change the following values:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="verbose console=ttyS0,115200n8 reboot=bios"
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --unit=0 --speed=115200"
GRUB_TERMINAL=serial
```

Now we'll have to write grub to the MBR again:

```
sudo update-grub
```

We'll also add a system service that provides a tty over the serial port.
Create `/etc/init/ttyS0.conf` and write the following to it:

```
# ttyS0 - getty
#
# Getty on ttyS0
#

start on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]

respawn
exec /sbin/getty -8 115200 -L ttyS0
```

Reboot the system. You should now be able to watch it boot via the serial port
and login once it's done.
